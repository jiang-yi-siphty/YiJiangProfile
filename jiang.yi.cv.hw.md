Dear Ms/Mr,

I’m writing to express my interest in the recently advertised iOS developer role at SEEK. The position’s duties and responsibilities is matching with my expeirence. I would bring my skills to the position including effective communication skills.  
 
I got an IT master degree from Macquarie University. I got another Engineering Study Master degree from UTS. C is my mother language in ICT domain. I have 7 years working experience with Security Alarm System in the electronic industry. In these days, I play with PCB and Linux backend service and mobile apps all the time. I even have experience with National Instrument's LabVIEW to code tester program for hardware. 

In some projects, we create apps to talk with IP module (a PCB) on the alarm control panel. To remote control the alarm panel, the app needs to create, wrap and send IP package to the IP module. And, wait for the response back from the alarm system. Then, the app needs unwrap the IP package, decode the payloads. 

One of my project required to fetch messages from backend service. I built a backend service from the sketch in PHP and Go language.  The API of backend service was designed by me.  I chose RESTful as the backend service's style. 

The desire of new technology and geek spirit makes me a good iOS developer. I am good on Core Data, CALayer, MapKit, and so on. And, I am going to learn and play Core ML (machine learning), and ARKit. I am also following the modern design patterns, such as MVP and MVVM. Besides, my iOS developer community social network is my powerful support. I have many geek friends like me. 

For me, the most important thing in my next role is to keep developing my technical skills and build strong relationships with colleagues to inspire each other. Infinity study is developer's destiny. 

I am self-employed at the moment. I build a drone app for DJI drones with collision avoiding system. The reason I left Digiflex is I want to be a better iOS developer. Digiflex is my comfort zone. If I want to keep growing, I must push myself into the un-comfort zone, challenge new tasks, meet new friends.

The enclosed file resume that more fully details of my background and work experience, and how they relate to your position. I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position.

Thank you in advance for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,  
Yi JIANG
