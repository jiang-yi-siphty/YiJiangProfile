##Apps & Software
###[MyAlarm SMS Control](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/myalarm-sms-control/id585238523?mt=8)  
Key Tech: Objective-C, iOS 
Note: App requires compatible alarm system to function and currently only works with iPhone devices. See below for more information.  
Description: The Myalarm SMS Control App allows you to easily create and save SMS templates which can then be sent your security system to arm or disarm areas, operate outputs, unlock doors or to check system status. This means you will have the ability remotely control your system anywhere you have mobile coverage. Each template can be given a unique and descriptive name simplifying operation, and for further peace of mind, a confirmation SMS message can be sent by your alarm system to your phone if requested. Multiple sites or alarm systems can be setup with their own unique templates allowing you to control your home, office, holiday home or other buildings with the one app.

##Academic Projects
###2008 School Zone Vehicle Warring System (SZVWS) (MQ University)
This project is developing an on-board warring system for recognizing simple traffic sign on the sides of road, such as School Zone Sign.  I charged the design of dynamic video analysis module, the kernel of SZVWS, independently. I utilized OpenCV algorithm to train system in C++ language environment. 
 
###2008 Localization and Mapping System for Mobile Robot (MQ University)
I charged Localization module in this project. Our team utilized Kalman Filter to calculate previous location and new leaser beam measurement result to find out the location of mobile robot in the foregone map. 
 
###2008 Chatting terminal with cryptography (MQ University)
In order to fulfill this project, I used Java cryptography API write security chatting terminal with public key, private key and public key infrastructure (PKI).
 
###2007 Mock Loop Control Experiment (UTS)
On the blood loop simulate instrument, we used LabVIEW to research and compare PID control method with fuzzy logic control method.  Finally, we break the record by driving blood pressure to specified pressure at most 0.2 second. 
 
###2004 Real-time Operation System for 8051 MCU (Lanzhou University)
My graduation project is developing simple real-time operation system for 8051 MCU. I wrote watchdog code to separate time into small time-slots and distributed different priorities to small threads.
