##Apps & Software
###[MyAlarm SMS Control](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/myalarm-sms-control/id585238523?mt=8) for iPhone
Technology Keywords: Objective-C, iOS 
Note: App requires compatible alarm system to function and currently only works with iPhone devices. See below for more information.  
Description: The Myalarm SMS Control App allows you to easily create and save SMS templates which can then be sent your security system to arm or disarm areas, operate outputs, unlock doors or to check system status. This means you will have the ability remotely control your system anywhere you have mobile coverage. Each template can be given a unique and descriptive name simplifying operation, and for further peace of mind, a confirmation SMS message can be sent by your alarm system to your phone if requested. Multiple sites or alarm systems can be setup with their own unique templates allowing you to control your home, office, holiday home or other buildings with the one app.
